# pneumonia-with-cnn

Within this repo, I will be taking data provided from https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia To create a Neural Network to predict based of a chest xray image if a patient has pneumonia.

In this repo you will find a jupyter notbook file documenting all of my progress and findings: <br>
[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/PaulWill92/pnuemonia-with-cnn/blob/master/index.ipynb) <br>
and my powerpoint slides explaining my findings: <br>
